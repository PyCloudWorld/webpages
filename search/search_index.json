Why would you want to control access to an object? Here is an example: you have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources. You need it from time to time, but not always. You could implement lazy initialization: create this object only when it\u2019s actually needed. All of the object\u2019s clients would need to execute some deferred initialization code. Unfortunately, this would probably cause a lot of code duplication. Solution The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original object\u2019s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it. But what\u2019s the benefit? If you need to execute something either before or after the primary logic of the class, the proxy lets you do this without changing that class.
